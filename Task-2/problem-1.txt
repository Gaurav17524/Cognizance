PSEUDO CODE:-
Write pseudocode and flowchart for a program that outputs ‘True’ if a given number is divisible by 3 and ‘False’ otherwise, without using the ‘%’ operator explicitly (like N % 3 == 0).

#######this program will allow the user to check whether a number is divisible by 3########


print"Enter a number"           #it will print "enter the number" in the console
a = user_input        #input number will be stored in variable "a" as string
b = length of (a)       #it will count the length of input and store in b
d = 0
e = integer(a)        #it will typecast the string into integer
For i = 1 to range of(a)     #we will run for loop to seperate the digits of a number
	c = e % 10     #modulo operator will seperate the digit from the number
	d = d+ c        #it will add the digits of a number
	e = e/10        
if "d%3==0"
      print response 
       "true"
else
     print response 
     "false"
