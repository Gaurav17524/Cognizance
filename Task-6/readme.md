## Here are some of the cyber security challenges faced in india:- ##

- Lack of national cyber security norms

***_Although different guidelines for cyber security training programs have been made up and are being implemented in different institutes, there’s no specific guideline related to the same. Unlike the other educational sector, no national or standard curriculum has been established for imparting education related to cyber security training in India. Although a few positions have been created towards this cause on the national platform, it is still a long way down the line._***

- No awareness among young Indians

***_As there is no national regulatory policy for cybersecurity training, there is a high lack of awareness among a huge Indian mind. Netizens are not aware of the basic ways to protect their data and legal frameworks. Although India has a big IT workforce, only a few are completely aware of the cyber security threats and prevention techniques that must be incorporated._***
